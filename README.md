# Project Starter

## Description

This allows me to start a new project with mocha and chai ready to go. I plan on adding more to this as needs arise, but for now I don't have any other things needed.

Use:
'''batch
start_project.bat (name of your project) (GitHub username)

### To Do

- [x] Create README.md
- [x] Initialize Git Repo for this project
- [x] Create the file that runs everything
  - [x] This should be a command line prompt
  - [x] git init
    - [x] create a .gitignore file
  - [x] Include test framework
    - [x] ensure test in package.json = "test": "mocha"
    - [x] setup 'hello world' test
  - [x] npm init
    - [x] initial default file (index.js)
    - [x] npm install -D mocha chai
